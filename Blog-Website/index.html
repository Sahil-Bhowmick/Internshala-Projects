        Hello! I'm Sahil Bhowmick, a Computer Science graduate with a B.Tech in
        Computer Science and Engineering. Alongside my enthusiasm for web
        development and technology, I also have a great passion for traveling
        and trying out different foods. This blog is a showcase of my travels,
        from the scenic beauty of Darjeeling to the relaxing beaches of Digha,
        and my experiences with the exciting street food of Kolkata that I
        discovered during my college years. Through these posts, I aim to share
        my adventures, provide useful tips, and hopefully inspire you to explore
        new places and tastes. I hope you enjoy reading about my journeys as
        much as I enjoyed experiencing them!

          In 2019, I went to Darjeeling with my family. It was a great break

          peaceful environment. Highlights included exploring tea gardens and
          breathing the fresh mountain air.

        <p class="blog-intro">
          A tasty adventure through Kolkata's street foods.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          During my college years in Kolkata from 2018 to 2022, I explored the
          city's rich street food scene. From late-night food hunts to finding
          hidden food spots, each experience was an adventure. I loved trying
          different dishes and sweets, making it a highlight of my college life.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
          Kolkata's street food is full of flavors and textures, showing the
          city's rich food traditions. From spicy chaats to sweet treats like
          rasgulla, each dish tells a story of Kolkata's lively food culture.
          Here’s what I enjoyed:

            Trying popular dishes like puchka (pani puri) and kathi rolls from
            street vendors.
          </li>

          <li class="blog-highlight">
            <strong>Vikram’s Kachori and Chaat:</strong> On College Street, this
            place is known for spicy kachoris and chaats. I enjoyed the crispy
            kachoris with spicy tamarind chutney. It was a hit with my friends
            and me. The lively atmosphere made it even better.
          </li>
          <li class="blog-highlight">
            <strong>Kwality Wall’s:</strong> This famous spot on Park Street is
            known for its tasty rolls. The mutton kathi roll, with juicy meat in
            a soft paratha, was a favorite during my late-night food runs.

          <li class="blog-highlight">
            <strong>Paramount:</strong> Famous for traditional Bengali sweets,
            this place on Bentinck Street is known for its delicious rasgullas
            and sandesh. I loved the rasgullas, which were a perfect end to many
            of my meals.
          </li>
          <li class="blog-highlight">
            <strong>New Alambazar’s Fish Curry:</strong> This street food stall
            near New Alambazar is known for its tasty fish curry and rice. The
            rich, flavorful curry and fresh fish made it a memorable meal.
          </li>
          <li class="blog-highlight">
            <strong>Arsalan:</strong> Although more of a restaurant, its biryani
            is famous. The spicy and fragrant biryani with tender chicken made
            it one of my favorite places for a hearty meal.
